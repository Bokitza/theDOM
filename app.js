// 1. fix DRONESOFT into drorsoft. go to w3schools to learn more about deleting and adding elements...

// 2. fix "coding your burekas" to "coding your dreams"

// 3. exchange the background to something more nice when the user is clicking somewhere on the screen...
//  search for "add event listener" to learn more about "on click" events if you dont know yet

// 4. go to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ and see the API to download some fake data in json.
